# Data Mining Final Projects

This repository contains projects submitted as the final assignment for the **Data Mining** module. The projects focus on key data mining techniques applied to real-world datasets.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Grocery Market Transactions Analysis
- **Objective:** Analyze transaction data to uncover hidden patterns and relationships between purchased items.
- **Techniques Used:**
  - Apriori Algorithm
  - Association Rules Mining
- **Key Outcomes:** Identified frequently co-purchased items and generated rules to optimize product placement and marketing strategies.
- **Paper:** This project includes a research article detailing the methodology, findings, and implications of the analysis.
- **Notebook:** Contains the full implementation with explained code.

### 2. Customer Segmentation (First Version)
- **Objective:** Segment customers based on purchasing behavior to support targeted marketing.
- **Techniques Used:**
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering
- **Key Outcomes:** Defined distinct customer groups, allowing businesses to tailor their marketing efforts and improve customer engagement.
- **Future Work:** This is the first version of the project, with plans to extend it by incorporating a recommendation system.
- **Paper:** This project includes a research article outlining the clustering techniques applied and the resulting segmentation insights.
- **Notebook:** Contains the full implementation with explained code.
